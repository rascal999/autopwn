autopwn (API package)

* Import target list/file etc (apk or ip list)
* Authentication (users can only access own jobs)
* TLS/SSL
* Add new tools
- nmap monlist
- snmpwalk
* Develop assessments (could be client side?)
- Tried to develop assessments on server side. This included a new job list for
  assessments and tried to work with return code on this (which was badly coded and
  broken anyway). Have decided to only provide assessments and assessment tools server
  side. It is the responsibility of the client to submit each tool in the assesment
  to the job list while specifying the correct parameters. I believe this is a better
  approach, however now in order to export a successful assessment, it becomes necessary
  to export each individual tool for that assessment, as opposed to one zip. This may
  need handling client side also.
